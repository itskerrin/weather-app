Very simple weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Never previously attempted one so wanted to give it a try. Search for a city to see the local weather information. Background images change based on the weather description. Looking to add a night time feature to locations. 

Uses the openweathermap.org API. All background images are from unsplash.com.
